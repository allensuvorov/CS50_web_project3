# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Notes:

### Models:
    * order

### Insights:
    * Order history needs absolute values, not links to values in ther tables, cause items get modified and deleted.
    * Admin needs the list of all combinations to add a price to each of them.
    * Reasons to create tables for each pizza option (types, sizes, toppings options): 1) to be able to display them on the menu.
